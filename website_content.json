Tucking & Finishing Process Method of Tucking The tucks of the splice are made over one strand and under one strand against the lay of the rope. The heart strand of the rope is not removed when strands are opened for tucking, but may be cut to a suitable length. Professional Finishing The ends of the splice are tightly served with seizing wire after parceling with canvas, hessian or wax paper. This ensures maximum durability and protection against environmental factors. This professional finishing process creates a smooth, streamlined connection that minimizes wear and maximizes the lifespan of your slings.
